# Realtime Clock (RTC) Words

zeptoforth has support for reading and setting the realtime clock (RTC) on the Raspberry Pi Pico, both for keeping track of the date and time and for triggering an alarm.

Note that the Raspberry Pi Pico's RTC's value is not preserved across resets, even if power is applied, so each time it is reset the RTC's value must be provided a value before it can be useful. It is initialized on bootup to Thursday, 1 January 1970 00:00:00, and is enabled on boot.

The alarm functionality allows triggering an alarm interrupt at a given combination of second, minute, hour, day of the week, day, month, and/or year values. Note that the alarm interrupt must either reset the alarm date/time to a new one or clear the alarm or otherwise it will be repeatedly triggered, which in most use cases is undesirable.

Date time values are validated when provided, except that year values of -1 and values for other fields of $FF are ignored during validation, as they are explicit non-values used for setting a subset of RTC fields or matching against a subset of RTC fields.

Also provided is code for formatting date/times as strings and printing them to the console, for convenience's sake.

Note that a subset of these words are provided for platforms other than the Raspberry Pi Pico, specifically all of these words aside from `enable-rtc`, `disable-rtc`, `date-time!`, `simple-date-time!`, `set-rtc-alarm`, and `clear-rtc-alarm`.

### `rtc`

The following words are in the `rtc` module:

##### `date-time-size`
( -- bytes )

This returns the size of a date/time structure in bytes.

##### `date-time-year`
( date-time -- addr )

This returns the address of a cell in a date/time containing a year, from 0 to 4095, or when not setting a year or not matching against a year, -1

##### `date-time-month`
( date-time -- c-addr )

This returns the address of a byte in a date/time containing a month, from 1 to 12, or when not setting a month or not matching against a month, 255

##### `date-time-day`
( date-time -- c-addr )

This returns the address of a byte in a date/time containing a day, from 1 to any of 28, 29, 30, or 31 depending on the month and year, or when not setting a day or not matching against a day, 255

##### `date-time-dotw`
( date-time -- c-addr )

This returns the address of a byte in a date/time containing a day of the week, from 0 representing Sunday to 6 representing Saturday, or when not setting a day of the week or not matching against a day of the week, 255.

##### `date-time-hour`
( date-time -- c-addr )

This returns the address of a byte in a date/time containing an hour, from 0 to 23, or when not setting an hour or not matching against an hour, 255.

##### `date-time-minute`
( date-time -- c-addr )

This returns the address of a byte in a date/time containing a minute, from 0 to 59, or when not setting a minute or not matching against a minute, 255.

##### `date-time-second`
( date-time -- c-addr )

This returns the address of a byte in a date/time containing a second, from 0 to 59, or when not setting a second or not matching against a second, 255.

##### `enable-rtc`
( -- )

Enable the realtime clock. (Note that it is enabled by default.)

##### `disable-rtc`
( -- )

Disable the realtime clock.

##### `date-time-equal?`
( date-time0 date-time1 -- equal? )

Check whether two date-times are equal (ignoring the day of the week).

##### `date-time@`
( date-time -- )

Get the current date/time.

##### `date-time!`
( date-time -- )

Set the current date/time.

##### `simple-date-time!`
( year month day hour minute second -- )

A convenience word to the current date/time at once, automatically calculating the day of the week. The arguments have the same meanings, respectively, as the `date-time-year`, `date-time-month`, `date-time-day`, `date-time-hour`, `date-time-minute`, and `date-time-second` of a date/time structure except that for all of these, not just the *year*, may have values of -1 to indicate unchanged values. Also, note that if *year* is -1, *month* is -1 or 255, or *day* is -1 or 255, the day of the week is not changed.

##### `set-rtc-alarm`
( date-time xt -- )

Set *xt* to execute as an RTC alarm interrupt handler at *date-time*, ignoring a year field of -1 and any of the other fields of 255. Note that when *xt* is executed it must reset the RTC alarm to a new date/time or clear the RTC alarm or else it will be triggered repeatedly.

##### `clear-rtc-alarm`
( -- )

Clear the RTC alarm.

##### `dotw-name`
( dotw -- c-addr u )

Get the name of a day of the week.

##### `month-name`
( month -- c-addr u )

Get the name of a month.

##### `max-date-time-format-size`
( -- bytes )

Get the maximum size in bytes of a date formated with `format-date-time`.

##### `format-date-time`
( c-addr date-time -- c-addr u )

Format *date-time* as a string starting at *c-addr*, and return the resulting string as the pair *c-addr* *u*.

##### `date-time.`
( date-time -- )

Print a date/time as formatted with `format-date-time`.

##### `get-dotw`
( date-time -- dotw )

Calculate the day of the week for a date/time, ignoring its day of the week field; 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday. Note that if the `date-time-year` field of *date-time* is -1, the `date-time-month` field of *date-time* is 255, or the `date-time-day` field of *date-time* is 255, 255 will be returned for the day of the week.

##### `update-dotw`
( date-time )

Update the day of the week for a date/time, ignoring its preexisting day of the week field. Note that if the `date-time-year` field of *date-time* is -1, the `date-time-month` field of *date-time* is 255, or the `date-time-day` field of *date-time* is 255, 255 will be set for the day of the week.

##### `convert-secs-since-1970`
( seconds date-time -- )

Set a day-time with seconds from 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
